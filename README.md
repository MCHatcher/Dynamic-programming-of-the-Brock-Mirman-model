# Dynamic-programming-of-the-Brock-Mirman-model
This repository contains Matlab code to solve a simple Brock-Mirman model using dynamic programming (cases of 2 states and arbitrary no. of states, nz). 
The code is based on the teaching notes of my coauthor Panayiotis Pourpourides (Cardiff). Notes: https://sites.google.com/view/panayiotismpourpourides/teaching.
