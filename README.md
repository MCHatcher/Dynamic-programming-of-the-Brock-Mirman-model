# Dynamic-programming-of-the-Brock-Mirman-model
This repository contains Matlab code to solve a simple 2-state Brock-Mirman model using dynamic programming. There is also an extension to the N-state case. 
The code is based on the teaching notes of my coauthor Panayiotis Pourpourides (Cardiff). Notes: https://sites.google.com/view/panayiotismpourpourides/teaching.
